Course materials for the
[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/introduction-to-machine-learning-COMP0088)
module at [UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/), for delivery in
Term 1 (September-December 2025). This is a secondary site for publicly-accessible resources,
notably those used by the Colab notebooks for the weekly lab sessions.
The primary hub for the module is its [UCL Moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=48872).

## Lectures

Pre-recorded lecture videos can be found on the module [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCro89CYRFPJaNppYFuBqoIA).

PDF slide decks to accompany the lectures are in the [lectures repo](https://github.com/comp0088/lectures).

## Labs

Colab notebooks are linked below. Click the link to open in Colab. You will probably receive a warning that the notebook was not authored by Google, which is obviously true â€” please trust it anyway. Once opened, you will need to save a copy in your own Google Drive in order to be able to save your changes.

Ancient `.py` version of the assignments can be found in the [labs repo](https://github.com/comp0088/labs). If for some reason you can't or don't wish to use Colab, you are welcome to use these instead. The material covered is pretty similar, but note that they have not been updated in several years and TAs will not provide technical support for them or for your local Python setup.
