Course materials for the
[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/introduction-to-machine-learning-COMP0088)
module at [UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/), for delivery in
Term 1 (October-December 2023). This is a secondary site for publicly-accessible resources,
notably those used by the Colab notebooks for the weekly lab sessions.
The primary hub for the module is its [UCL Moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=33722).

## Lectures

Pre-recorded lecture videos can be found on the module [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCro89CYRFPJaNppYFuBqoIA).

PDF slide decks to accompany the lectures are in the [lectures repo](https://github.com/comp0088/lectures).

## Labs

Colab notebooks will be linked below. Click the link to open in Colab. You will probably receive a warning that the notebook was not authored by Google, which is obviously true — please trust it anyway. Once opened, you will need to save a copy in your own Google Drive in order to be able to save your changes.

The older `.py` version of the assignments can be found in the [labs repo](https://github.com/comp0088/labs). If for some reason you can't or don't wish to use Colab, you are welcome to use these instead — the material covered is very similar — but note that TAs will not provide technical support for these versions or for your local Python setup.
